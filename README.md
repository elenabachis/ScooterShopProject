With the help of I helped design an app for a Scooter Shop which can add, remove or update Scooters.

Other functionalities:
F1. A customer is able to reserve one or more scooters.
F2. A customer is able to see the list of their reserved scooters.
F3. The programme is able to select a storage mode at the beginning: volatile or persistent. 
Volatile means that the data is lost at the end of the programme. Persistent means that 
the data is saved in a file.
